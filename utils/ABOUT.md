> Forest Restoration Planning

WePlan - Forests is a decision support platform for tropical and subtropical forest ecosystem restoration planning that aims to maximise the climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation benefits arising from forest restoration.

The project provides quantitative, spatial, evidence-based planning support to developing countries that are party to the Convention on Biological Diversity in order to facilitate the realisation of forest restoration pledges and targets.

The platform consists of a user-friendly SEPAL-based interface to retreive the Geospatial data from each computed scenarios from the weplan forest project. 

More information about the computation and statical data can be found on the [weplan forest platform website](http://weplan-forests.org).
